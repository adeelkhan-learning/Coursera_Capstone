In our daily routine commuting, it is always advisable to take the route which has less blockage or rush due to accidents. Our main purpose here is to build a model which can predict a model to assist the daily commuters avoiding these issues.<br><br>\n* There are many factors which causes the accidents and to predict the pattern using these factors can be very helpful to avoid such incidents. Imagine an accident occurring at a particular place or time many times and by analysis we find the relation of the occurrence of accident with factors which can be avoided or warned against. <br><br>\n* This will be highly beneficial for authorities to take necessary steps and implement a plan for drivers to avoid it from happening in future."
